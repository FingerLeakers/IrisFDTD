-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**The paper was a theoretical study on the non-linear optical properties of both gold and nickel slit arrays inlaid with a third order nonlinear dielectric medium. We investigated the Optical Kerr Effect and Third Harmonic Generation in these typical systems in Nanophotonics. In this version of the IrisFDTD program the results found in *PRB 83, 235425 (2011)* can be easily reproduced. Below the examples are listed:**

+ *cexe_2-6*: Several points of Fig.2(c)-(d), calculated for a gaussian wave.
+ *cexe 7-11*: Several points of Fig.2(c), calculated for a real-valued plane wave.
