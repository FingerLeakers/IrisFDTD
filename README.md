*Finite-Difference Time-Domain method* 
---------------------------------------

The FDTD method has been applied in a great variety of engineering and physical problems since originally proposed in 1966 by K. Yee [1]. The FDTD method has been developed over the years, being one of the most spread methods in computational electromagnetism worldwide. In a nutshell, the optical properties of a given system (a living cell, an aircraft, a nanostructure…)  are obtained through calculations of the  electromagnetic field, which is propagated in discretized space and discretized time, according to both Maxwell equations and the constitutive relations (which state how materials respond to the EM field).  FDTD thus provides the whole “movie” of the electromagnetic field evolution of a given system. This information is then post-processed to obtain the EM response of the considered system.

*IrisFDTD* has been devoloped with the focus on the field of Nanoptics. Nanooptics aims at the understanding of optical phenomena at the nanoscale, beyond the realm of conventional optics and the diffraction limit of light. It is an emerging new field, which opens up new perspectives into the Nanoworld. It is motivated by the rapid growth of nanotechnology and material science. The former supplies the adequate tools and strategies for fabrication, manipulation and characterization of nanosystems, whereas the latter provides the material platforms required for the realization of specific optical effects. Undoubtedly, Nanooptics research is a very promising pathway towards the overcoming of some of the most immediate social challenges, such as the seek for novel technological grounds allowing further development of the knowledge and information   society and the search for clean, efficient energy sources. Therefore, the improvement of the numerical methods and computer technology to be applied in Nanooptics must be a goal by itself. 

*IrisFDTD* has been applied to several problems in Nanoptics [2], to name a few, it has been used to investigate the optical response of nano-structures based on 2d-atomically thin materials like Boron Nitride, with potential applications in optoelectronics in both infrared and THz regimes, and the study of non-linear effects in Nanophotonics, for their potential applications in high-resolution enhanced spectroscopies. The number of physical systems investigated with *IrisFDTD* is quite huge. Most of them gave raise to publications which can be found in the scientific literature (see Ref. [3]).
